Navigating the CNCF Ecosystem: Overcoming Challenges as a Newcomer in Graduated Projects

## Abstract

Are you a budding contributor yearning to make your mark in the expansive CNCF ecosystem, yet find yourself daunted by its sheer magnitude?

Pradumna and Shivang, who have previously made contributions to various CNCF projects such as Kubernetes, Layer5 (Meshery), and Armada, shed light on the intricate challenges that newcomers encounter when entering the dynamic CNCF ecosystem. Specifically, they delve into the hurdles faced by newcomers when contributing to graduated projects like Kubernetes. The overwhelming number of contributors can hinder newcomers from gaining footing in the project, primarily due to the project's immense scale and complexity. This can demotivate newcomers from seeking timely feedback and validation.

Instead of getting discouraged, contributors are encouraged to focus on the vibrant realm of incubating and sandbox projects. These initiatives offer quicker feedback, faster validation, and ample room for individuals to make a significant impact.
